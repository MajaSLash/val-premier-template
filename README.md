#Abstract

This is a team roster scheduling template created by me (primarily for VALORANT Premier). 
NOTE: This speadsheet was created in Google Sheets. There will be some inconsistancies when using this file in Microsoft Excel.

##Features
- Dynamic updating for up to 10 roster spots, including player names, substitution status, and schedule
- Schedule listing is both horizonal and vertical (so you don't have to deal with that pesky horizontal scroll bar)
- 'Game Ready?'/'Playing?'/'Subs Available?' status highlights when requirements are met

##Future Updates
- Improvement on defining 'main' and 'substitute' players on roster listings and schedule
- Agents preferred determines team composition for each roster lineup for each match day
- Comparison to meta team composition based on map
- History tracker with win percentage of each map, team composition, and player
- Statisics tracker of each player in a 'match report' system
